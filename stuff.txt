the reason there isn't a bin/detect in a lot of these is because of packit: https://paketo.io/docs/howto/create-paketo-buildpack/
- it uses a Golang detect function - watchexec/watchexec/detect.go
used `jam pack \
        --buildpack ./buildpack.toml  \
        --stack io.buildpacks.stacks.bionic \
        --offline \
        --output watchexec.tgz \
        --version 1.15.3`
to build watchexec.tgz for watchexec. had to comment out metadata.dependencies.licenses because of error
`failed to execute: failed to parse buildpack.toml: \
    json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field Config.metadata of type string`
also, spelled "metadata" correctly

pack build ruby-app --buildpack paketo-buildpacks/bundler --path ./ruby-sample-app/
works! does not work with ruby buildpack though.

go builder = go-builder
pack create-builder go-builder --config ./builder.toml
pack build go-app --builder go-builder --path ./ruby-sample-app/
fails because the .go file doesn't have any "package", which is okay because the file is empty and doesn't matter

watchexec builder = watchexec-builder
pack create-builder watchexec-builder --config ./builder.toml
pack build watchexec-app --builder watchexec-builder --path ./ruby-sample-app/
